I started my first day as an _associate design and development engineer_ with a healthy dose of [imposter syndrome](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Impostor_syndrome){:target="_blank"}:

> Imposter Syndrome - psychological pattern in which an individual doubts their accomplishments and has a persistent internalized fear of being exposed as a "fraud".

I had worked for three years since graduation in random jobs (supermarket, recording studio, major ISP) with increasingly technical roles, always aligning myself towards a job in software development.

Finally, after years of off-hours learning and crappy personal websites, here I was sitting in front of my new powerful workstation. I had a title with "engineer" in it. But I still felt like a cashier.

## Managing Expectations

(Be open with junior devs about this topic)

I’ve seen the entire gamut as far as “readiness” goes in new software engineers. Sometimes your new developer is an intern with literally no college programming classes, and sometimes he or she is a 4.0 student with a Computer Sciences degree. Personally, I fell somewhere in the middle of the two when I started my first real job as a developer.

Regardless of the experience that a junior developer brings from school, there are invariably large gaps in knowledge that make it difficult for first-time engineers to hit the ground running. Those gaps are so glaring that I felt the need to [write a book helping new engineers address them](https://www.amazon.com/How-your-First-Software-Engineer-ebook/dp/B06XZQ6G46){:target="_blank"}.
