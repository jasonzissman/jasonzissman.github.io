# Accessibile Applications

Before we start, I'd like to provide some definition for the topic of accessibility. In this article, an application is *accessibile* when it can be _fully experienced_ by populations with different degrees of visual, auditory, and motor impairments.

## The need

A growing number of companies are adopting accessibility initiatives for their user-facing applications. The catalyst is often a customer request or changing legal requirements. 

As a development organization, taking on an accessibility commitment can be daunting. This is especially true when you have legacy products and no team knowledge on the topic. In early 2018, my teams were presented with a similar scenario. Several of our applications had to meet accessibility requirements before a large customer would purchase. We had limited knowledge of accessibility on our teams, and our products reflected this.

As a development organization, how do you transform your teams and processes to support a user base with drastically different needs?

## What exactly makes an application accessible?

The answer to this question requires reflection. How does a user *experience* your application today? Consider the following:

1. When you view a Google search results page, you don't just see text. You see a logical organization and a thousand visual cues. Links have a blue color to indicate that can be clicked. Search results titles are bigger than description text. Supplemental information is to the side, while main search results are in the middle. _How would you perceive this if you could not see?_

## Who is impacted?

## Why are we doing this?

- Digital wheelchair ramps
- Increases usage
- Greatly enhances perception of brand
- Users without impairments reap benefits
- Competition is doing it
- Is and will continue to become a legal requirement
