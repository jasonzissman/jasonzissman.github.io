# Accessibile Applications

Before we start, I'd like to provide a quick definition. In this article, *accessibile applications* are ones that can be _fully experienced_ by populations with different degrees of visual, auditory, and motor impairments.

## The need

A growing number of companies are adopting accessibility initiatives for their user-facing applications. The catalyst is often a customer request or changing legal requirements. As the majority of business models implement a digital interface for their products, considerations must be made for customers and users with different impairments.

## The difficulty

As a development organization, taking on an accessibility commitment can be daunting. This is especially true when you have legacy products and no team knowledge on the topic. 

In early 2018, my teams were presented with a similar scenario. Several of our applications had to meet accessibility requirements before a large customer would finalize a purchase. Our teams had limited knowledge of accessibility practices, and our products reflected this. 

How do you transform your teams and processes to support a user base with drastically different needs?

## First: what exactly makes an application accessible?

The answer to this question requires some reflection. How does a user *experience* a website today? Consider the following:

1. When you view a Google search results page, you don't just see text results. You see a logical organization and a thousand visual cues. Links have a blue color to indicate that can be clicked. Search results titles are bigger than description text. Supplemental information is to the side, while main search results are in the middle. _How could you perceive these same cues if you could not see?_

2. When you make a purchase on Amazon, you don't just click the "buy" button. You filter through categories. You select items to compare against each other. You add items to a cart, etc. _How would you accomplish these actions if you are physically unable to use a mouse?_

An underlying goal of accessibility is to make the *entire experience* of an application available to everyone, including those with limited visual, auditory, or motor abilities. As such, an application can be considered accessible when it meets the following:

1. All information and cues are perceivable and understandable by users with visual impairments
2. All actionable elements are operable by users unable to use a mouse

## Who is impacted?



## Why are we doing this?

- Digital wheelchair ramps
- Increases usage
- Greatly enhances perception of brand
- Users without impairments reap benefits
- Competition is doing it
- Is and will continue to become a legal requirement
