_This is the second part in a series of blog entries on making web applications accessible._

Below is a quick list of accessibility items that can be referenced during development and testing. Notice that it is not exhaustive.

## Accessibility Testing Items

- Can every actionable element (button, link) be accessed via the "tab" key on the keyboard?
- Does all displayed text meet color contrast requirements? (check with https://webaim.org/resources/contrastchecker/)
- Can the screen reader access all the information displayed on the page?
- Do dialogs and modals create focus traps? Can they be closed with the escape key?
- Is the screen reader alerted when a notification appears?
