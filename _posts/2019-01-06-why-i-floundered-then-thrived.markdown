I've seen the entire gamut as far as "readiness" goes in new software engineers. Sometimes your new developer is an intern with literally no college programming classes, and sometimes he or she is a 4.0 student with a Computer Sciences degree. Personally, I fell somewhere in the middle of the two when I started my first real job as a developer.

Regardless of the experience that you bring from school, there are invariably large gaps in knowledge that make it difficult for new junior engineers to hit the ground running. Those gaps are so glaring that I felt the need to [write a book helping new engineers address them](https://www.amazon.com/How-your-First-Software-Engineer-ebook/dp/B06XZQ6G46){:target="_blank"}.

As a team lead or manager you can (and must!) help orient your new junior engineers. Problems arise, however, when your development organization doesn't have the process and personalities to properly mentor new junior engineers. This is what happened to me as a new software engineer at my first job.

## Pair with the contractor
I started my first day as an _associate design and development engineer_ with a healthy dose of imposter syndrome. I had worked consistently for three years since graduation in random jobs (supermarket, recording studio, major ISP) with increasingly technical roles, always aligning myself towards a job in software development. Finally, here I was, sitting in front of my new workstation, still feeling like a cashier.

My new software dev team was relatively small. There were 5 other developers and sometimes a QA.
